                <p class="about-Astrophysics">
                    Astrophysics, the study of the physics of the universe, emerged from astronomy in the 17th century with scientists like Newton arguing for common physical laws for celestial and terrestrial realms, and gained momentum with the development of spectroscopy in the 19th century, allowing for the study of stellar composition. 
                    Astrophysics is a branch of space science that uses the principles of physics and chemistry to study the universe, exploring topics like the formation, evolution, and properties of celestial objects, from stars and planets to galaxies and the cosmos itself.

                 <p class="about-Astrometry">
                    Astrometry is the science of measuring the position and movement of celestial objects, such as stars and planets. It's a branch of astronomy that helps us understand the physical origin of our solar system and galaxy. 
                    <li>How does astrometry work? </li>
                    <li>Astrometry measures the position of a star in the sky compared to other stars.</li>
                    <li>It looks for a regular wobble in the star's position.</li>
                    <li>If a periodic shift is detected, it's likely that the star is being orbited by a planet.</li>

                    Astrogeology, also known as planetary geology or exogeology, is the study of the geology of celestial bodies, including planets, moons, asteroids, and comets, using geological principles to understand their formation, structure, and evolution.
